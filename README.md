Building a very simple blog style app using microservice architecture

I followed along with [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/) from Udemy to learn microservice architecture. The course goes through building out multiple services to handle some basic blog style functionality, including an event broker with event syncing, from scratch. There is also a UI built to allow the user to interact with the service using React and Bootstrap.
